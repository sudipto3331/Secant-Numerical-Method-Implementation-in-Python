# Secant-Numerical-Method-Implementation-in-Python
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Secant Method for finding roots of nonlinear equations. The code includes input validation, iteration, and termination based on the desired error or reaching the maximum number of iterations. Results are saved into an Excel file (`secant.xls`).
